### Getting started

**Fork** and clone this repository. Then execute the following to run the tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Each test case starts out muted with `xit` - remove the `x` to make the test active!

You should perform the tests in the order they're listed in the `tests/` folder. 

The tests use `mocha` and `chai` together with [`enzyme`](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) (a test utility for React) and [`chai-enzyme`](https://github.com/producthunt/chai-enzyme) (a set of additional `expect` functionality for React that supplements `chai`.
